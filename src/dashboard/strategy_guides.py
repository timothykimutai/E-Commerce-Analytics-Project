    # Shopify Integration Options
    
    ## Option 1: Shopify App (Recommended)
    
    ### Development Requirements:
    * Register as a Shopify Partner and create a custom app
    * Use Shopify API to fetch customer and order data
    * Host this analytics solution on your own server or cloud provider
    * Deploy the Streamlit dashboard through Streamlit Cloud or convert to a Flask web app
    
    ### Integration Steps:
    1. Register as a Shopify Partner: https://partners.shopify.com
    2. Create a custom app in the Partner Dashboard
    3. Request the following permissions:
       - `read_customers` - Access customer data
       - `read_orders` - Access order data
       - `read_products` - Access product data
    4. Use the Shopify Admin API to fetch data regularly (daily or weekly)
    5. Process data through your analytics pipeline
    6. Store results in your database
    7. Serve insights through your dashboard
    
    ### Code Example for Shopify API Integration:
    ```python
    import shopify
    
    # Initialize Shopify API
    shop_url = "your-store.myshopify.com"
    api_key = "your-api-key"
    password = "your-api-password"
    
    shopify.ShopifyResource.set_site(f"https://{api_key}:{password}@{shop_url}/admin/api/2023-04")
    
    # Get orders data
    orders = shopify.Order.find(limit=250)
    
    # Process orders into the format needed for analytics
    processed_orders = []
    for order in orders:
        order_dict = order.to_dict()
        for item in order_dict.get('line_items', []):
            processed_orders.append({
                'CustomerID': order_dict.get('customer', {}).get('id'),
                'InvoiceNo': order_dict.get('order_number'),
                'ProductID': item.get('product_id'),
                'Description': item.get('name'),
                'Quantity': item.get('quantity'),
                'UnitPrice': item.get('price'),
                'InvoiceDate': order_dict.get('created_at'),
                'TotalAmount': float(item.get('price')) * item.get('quantity')
            })
    
    # Convert to DataFrame and proceed with analysis
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(processed_orders)
    ```
    
    ## Option 2: CSV Export/Import
    
    ### How It Works:
    1. Store owners export their orders and customers CSV from Shopify Admin
    2. They upload these files to your web application
    3. Your system processes the data and provides insights
    4. Store owners can download reports or view them online
    
    ### Integration Steps:
    1. Create a simple file upload interface in your Streamlit app
    2. Add instructions for exporting data from Shopify
    3. Process the uploaded CSV files
    4. Generate insights and recommendations
    
    ### Advantages:
    * No need for API integration
    * Works with any Shopify store
    * Simpler development
    
    ### Limitations:
    * Manual process for store owners
    * Less real-time data
    * More friction for users
    
    ## Option 3: Shopify Flow Integration (for Shopify Plus)
    
    For enterprise clients with Shopify Plus, you can integrate with Shopify Flow for automated workflows based on your analytics:
    
    1. Export analytics results to a webhook endpoint
    2. Configure Shopify Flow to trigger actions based on your insights
    3. Automate email campaigns, customer tagging, or special offers
    
    This allows for automated actions based on customer segmentation and churn predictions.
